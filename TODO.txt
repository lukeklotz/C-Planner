create new account [x]
    - check if username is unique
    - write user and pass to usernames.txt file and save to linkedlist 
load usernames.txt into linkedlist [x]
create enterUserInfo() function for userMngr[x]


figure out how to save unique files for each user[x]
	- when a new account is created, that account becomes associated with a unique key
	- the unique key is used to locate their folder in the database


fix linked list
	- not appending correctly for new account creation
